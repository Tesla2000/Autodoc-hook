## ClassDef CustomArgumentParser
**CustomArgumentParser**: The function of CustomArgumentParser is to extend the functionality of the argparse.ArgumentParser class to handle specific data types and argument configurations more effectively.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· add_argument: A method that adds command-line arguments to the parser, with special handling for boolean, list, and tuple types.

**Code Description**: The CustomArgumentParser class inherits from argparse.ArgumentParser and overrides the add_argument method to include custom logic for processing argument types. When adding an argument, if the type specified in the kwargs is a GenericAlias, it is converted to its origin type. The class also checks if the type is a subclass of bool, list, or tuple, and modifies the argument configuration accordingly:

- For boolean types, it assigns a custom conversion function (_str2bool) that interprets string representations of boolean values.
- For list types, it sets the number of arguments to accept as zero or more (using `nargs="*"`), and the type of each element is set to string.
- For tuple types, it sets the number of arguments to accept as one or more (using `nargs="+"`), also with each element being a string.

The _str2bool method is a helper function that converts string inputs into boolean values, raising an error if the input does not match expected boolean representations.

This class is utilized within the parse_arguments function found in the config.py file. The parse_arguments function creates an instance of CustomArgumentParser and iterates over the fields of a configuration class, dynamically adding arguments based on the field names and types. This integration allows for a structured and flexible approach to command-line argument parsing, ensuring that the arguments correspond to the configuration model defined by the user.

**Note**: When using the CustomArgumentParser, it is important to ensure that the types specified for arguments are compatible with the expected input formats. Developers should also be aware of the custom boolean conversion logic, as it may differ from standard interpretations of boolean values.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the parse_arguments function, which utilizes CustomArgumentParser, would be a Namespace object containing parsed arguments such as:
```
Namespace(config_value='some_value', flag=True, items=['item1', 'item2'])
```
### FunctionDef add_argument(self)
**add_argument**: The function of add_argument is to add command-line arguments to the CustomArgumentParser with specific handling for different data types.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: Positional arguments that are passed to the underlying add_argument method of the parent class.
· **kwargs: Keyword arguments that define the properties of the argument being added, such as type, default value, help message, etc.

**Code Description**: The add_argument method in the CustomArgumentParser class is designed to extend the functionality of the standard argument parser by incorporating specific type handling for boolean, list, and tuple data types. When invoked, it first checks if the "type" keyword argument is a GenericAlias, which is a way to specify generic types in Python. If so, it extracts the original type from the GenericAlias.

Next, the method evaluates the type of the argument being added. If the type is a subclass of bool, it assigns the _str2bool method to the "type" keyword argument. This ensures that any string representation of a boolean value is correctly converted to its actual boolean type when parsed. For list types, it sets the "nargs" keyword argument to "*", indicating that zero or more values can be provided, and it sets the type to str. Similarly, for tuple types, it sets "nargs" to "+", indicating that one or more values are required, and also sets the type to str.

After processing these specific cases, the method calls the parent class's add_argument method with the modified arguments. This integration allows the CustomArgumentParser to handle a wider range of argument types while maintaining compatibility with the standard argument parsing interface.

The add_argument method is called within the parse_arguments function, which is responsible for setting up the argument parser based on a provided configuration class. The parse_arguments function creates an instance of CustomArgumentParser and iterates over the fields of the configuration class, dynamically adding arguments using the add_argument method. This relationship is crucial as it allows for a flexible and structured approach to defining command-line arguments based on the configuration model.

**Note**: When using the add_argument method, it is important to ensure that the type specified in kwargs is valid and that any string representations of boolean values conform to the expected formats to avoid errors during parsing.

### FunctionDef _str2bool(self, v)
**_str2bool**: The function of _str2bool is to convert string representations of boolean values into actual boolean types.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· v: Any value that is to be converted to a boolean. This can be a boolean, a string, or any other type.

**Code Description**: The _str2bool method is designed to handle the conversion of various input types into boolean values. It first checks if the input value `v` is already a boolean; if so, it returns the value as is. If `v` is a string, the method converts it to lowercase and checks if it matches any of the predefined true representations: "yes", "true", "t", "y", or "1". If a match is found, it returns True. Conversely, if the string matches any of the false representations: "no", "false", "f", "n", or "0", it returns False. 

If the input does not match any of these expected values, the method raises an argparse.ArgumentTypeError, indicating that a boolean value was expected but an invalid value was provided. This strict validation ensures that only valid boolean representations are accepted, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the argument parsing process.

The _str2bool method is called within the add_argument method of the CustomArgumentParser class. When adding an argument of type bool, add_argument utilizes _str2bool to ensure that any string representation provided by the user is correctly interpreted as a boolean value before being added to the argument parser. This relationship is essential for the proper functioning of the CustomArgumentParser, as it guarantees that boolean arguments are processed accurately, enhancing the overall usability and reliability of the argument parsing functionality.

**Note**: Users of the _str2bool method should ensure that the input string is a valid representation of a boolean value to avoid triggering an ArgumentTypeError. This validation is critical for the correct processing of boolean arguments within the CustomArgumentParser.

**Output Example**: 
- Input: "yes" → Output: True
- Input: "no" → Output: False
- Input: "maybe" → Output: Raises argparse.ArgumentTypeError: "Boolean value expected got maybe."
